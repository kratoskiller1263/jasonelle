### [LogHandler](https://apple.github.io/swift-log/docs/current/Logging/Protocols/LogHandler.html)

A protocol which the log handlers must implement. It mainly contains a log function to pass the params.

### [MultiplexLogHandler](https://apple.github.io/swift-log/docs/current/Logging/Structs/MultiplexLogHandler.html)

An implementation of the LogHandler protocol. Can pass the log message to other log handlers. Useful if you wish to log messages to local and remote systems using different handlers.

### [StreamLogHandler](https://apple.github.io/swift-log/docs/current/Logging/Structs/StreamLogHandler.html)
