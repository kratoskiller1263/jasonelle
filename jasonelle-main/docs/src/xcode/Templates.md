# Templates

A template is a pre configured _App.xcworkspace_ file that
is tailored for a specific use case.

They are meant to be used as an starting point for your application.

You can easily update the core if needed, just by replacing the directories.

This template uses the [Agora SDK](https://agora.io) for realtime video application. It contains a bridge to show a view controller configured for _Agora_.

- Use: `$agora.start(appId, token, channel)` in your webview to show the controller.
- See [Examples](https://github.com/jasonelle/jasonelle/blob/template/agora/sources/xcode/Extensions/JLAgora/JLAgora/examples.html).

You can use it as a base for your own projects. It needs proper configuration and setup for your Agora Keys.
